Computer vision is an interdisciplinary field that deals with how computers can be made for gaining high-level understanding from digital images or videos. From the perspective of engineering, it seeks to automate tasks that the human visual system can do. Computer vision tasks include methods for acquiring, processing, analyzing and understanding digital images, and extraction of high-dimensional data from the real world in order to produce numerical or symbolic information, e.g., in the forms of decisions. Understanding in this context means the transformation of visual images into descriptions of the world that can interface with other thought processes and elicit appropriate action. This image understanding can be seen as the disentangling of symbolic information from image data using models constructed with the aid of geometry, physics, statistics, and learning theory.

In this project, I will try different algrithms to build a image classication model. The system is supposed to learn associations between word(lable) used to describe an image and the visual features found in it, and gets better at predicting descriptions on its own.

The candidate algrithms are:

### CNN from Scratch
### CNN from Transfer Learning
### Bag of Words model combining Supervised Learning and Unsupervised Learning
